# Sahil Yadav, B15130
# Docker Assessment

This task was pretty time consuming, which at first seemed to be a cake walk. I got to know about docker and how its containers help in collaborative work. I first had installed `docker.io` which is now [obsolete](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/45023363/what-is-docker-io-in-relation-to-docker-ce-and-docker-ee?answertab=votes#tab-top) but then reinstalled all the things following the official [guide for debian based systems](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/debian/). After several failed attempts of saving the `testfile.sh` in place, I observed that docker also saves snapshots of the system state just like git and so we need to [commit](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-install-and-use-docker-on-ubuntu-16-04#step-6-%E2%80%94-committing-changes-in-a-container-to-a-docker-image) the changes that we have made. After that I happily pushed my image's changes to the remote repository.

Rest is the assessment left with the moderators.

This is the [link](https://hub.docker.com/r/meydv5/ubuntu/) to the image.
